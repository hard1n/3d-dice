# 3d-dice
I made this to practice with 3D animation on CSS and JS.

I am using **transform** CSS property to create 3D effects on the HTML elements.
Used **translate** Property to create a 3D CUBE effect and **transitions** to make it rotate From JS.

Made buttons on the left side that rotate the Dice **on click** and below the dice that rotate it **on hover**
